# Regression_Model

I have tried to detect variables that can determine the acceleration of a vehicle. In our life we notice that many factors can influence the acceleration of a vehicle, for example the consumption per mile of diesel or gasoline of the vehicle, number of horsepower inside the engine of the vehicle, brand of the vehicle and number of years that the vehicle had being used.
To know more about determinants of the acceleration, we use a data that gather information about some 392 vehicles from different brand types.
In a first part, we will discover the variables (we will do both statistical and graphical exploration).
In a second part we will start building our model by including all the variables , and then making a selection of the best that explain the best acceleration, the selection of variables will be based on testing hypothesis and on comparing the full and the reduced model using ANOVA method.
after model selection we will discuss the effect of those selected variables on the acceleration and finally we will verify hypothesis related to the model we build, to verify if the model is strong enough.
